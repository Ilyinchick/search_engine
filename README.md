<dt>Introduction</dt>
<dd>
Hi. This is my graduation project of the course C++ developer from Skillbox. <br>
This project can help with finding needed document from base of document with requests. <br>
</dd>
<dt>Used technology stack</dt>
<dd>
In this project i used following technology: <br>
<ul>
<li><b>C++ - </b> classes, structures, thread, containers such as vector, set and map, 
serialization and deserialization, exception, etc.</li>
<li><b>Google Test - </b> also I added Google Testing C++ Framework to this project 
to track if my classes are working correctly. </li>
<li><b>JSON for modern C++ - </b> to serialize and deserialize data in this project 
I used nlohmann::json library</li>
<li><b>GitHub - </b> to control versions of this project I placed it on GitHub.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Instructions to run the project</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Download and extract this project. </li>
<li>If you want to add some txt files to search, you need to write paths to those files in file 
<a href="manage/config.json">config.json</a> ("manage" folder) </li>
<li>In file <a href="manage/requests.json">requests.json</a> ("manage" folder) you can add more requests
to search and adjust they to your needs. </li>
</ul>

If all is correct, you can run project in your IDE. <br>
In this project I used MinGW compiler.
