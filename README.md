Hi. This is my graduation project of the course C++ developer from Skillbox. <br>

<dt>Used technology stack</dt>
<dd>
In this project i used following technology: <br>
<ul>
<li><b>C++ - </b> classes, structures, thread, containers such as vector, set and map, 
serialization and deserialization, exception, etc.</li>
<li><b>Google Test - </b> also I added Google Testing C++ Framework to this project 
to track if my classes are working correctly. </li>
<li><b>JSON for modern C++ - </b> to serialize and deserialize data in this project 
I used nlohmann::json library</li>
<li><b>GitHub - </b> to control versions of this project I placed it on GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<dt>Instructions to run the project</dt>
<dd>
Download and extract this project. <br>
Download and extract <a href="https://github.com/nlohmann/json"> <b>JSON for modern C++</b> </a>
into root folder of project. Make sure that references in CMakeList.txt are valid for your paths. <br>
To run test you also need to download and extract <a href="https://github.com/google/googletest"> 
<b>Google Test Framework for C++</b></a> in root folder. 
In that case also check references in CMakeList.txt <br>
If all is correct, you can run project in your IDE. <br>
In this project I used MinGW compiler.
